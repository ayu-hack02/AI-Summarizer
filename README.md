# AI-Summarizer

# Introduction-
Text summaries are of two major types- Extractive and Abstractive. Extractive summaries are the ones that have sentences from the input itself, while Abstractive summaries have the same context but not exact sentences from the input.

# About the project-
This project consists of code for Text summarizer. It can take input text as well as can extract text from pdf and summarize it.

# Files in the Repository-
app.py - This is the code for an extractive summarizer. 
abs_app.py - This is the code for an abstractive summarizer.

# Libraries used-
Using Python as the programming language, I used Streamlit library for the web part. For the functionality, I used Transformers and pipeeline libraries. I also used PyPDF2 for extraction of text from pdf files.
